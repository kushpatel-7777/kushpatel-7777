### 🌟 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Kush Patel**, an enthusiastic learner and a future coder 🧑‍💻  
Right now, I’m on my **C language quest**, learning the magic behind logic, memory, and problem-solving.  

I love combining creativity with code — because programming, to me, feels like building your own universe ✨  

> 💬 Motto: *“Every error is just another mini-boss to defeat.”*

Here’s a little about me:
- ⚡ Exploring the world of **C programming** — from `printf()` to pointers.  
- 💡 Interested in understanding how computers really *think*.  
- 🧩 Problem-solving addict (even if it takes 10 tries).  
- ☕ Fueled by curiosity, music, and the occasional coffee overdose.  
- 🕹️ Aspiring to create something cool that others can use or play with.
